      <br />
      <p>
        <b>In short</b>: Some information – such as your Internet Protocol (IP)
        address and/or browser and device characteristics – is collected
        automatically when you visit our App.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or
        navigate the App. This information does not reveal your specific
        identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device
        and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device
        characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs,
        device name, country, location, information about how and when you use
        our App and other technical information. This information is primarily
        needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, and for our
        internal analytics and reporting purposes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-8">

          diagnostic, usage and performance information our servers

          data may include your IP address, device information, browser type and
          settings and information about your activity in the App (such as the
          date/time date/time stamp associated with your usage, pages and files
          viewed, searches and other actions you take such as which features you
          use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports

          about your device’s location, which can be either precise or
          imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
          settings of the device you use to access the App. For example, we may
          use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells
          us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out
          of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access
          to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your
          device. Not however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to
          use certain aspects of the Services.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold">

        More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your

      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold">
        3. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>In Short:</b> We may transfer, store, and process your information in
        countries other than your own.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our
        App from outside, please be aware that your information may be
        transferred to, stored, and processed by using our facilities and by
        those third parties with whom we may share your personal information, in
        the United States and other countries.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these
        countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar
        laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all
        necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance
        with this privacy notice and applicable laws.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold">
        4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to
        fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise
        required by law.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible ( for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold">
        5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a
        system of organizational and technical security measures.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
        storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
        promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
        third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
        collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
        our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only
        access the App within a secure environment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold">6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>In Short:</b> You may review, change, or terminate your account at
        any time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we
        are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the
        right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.

        7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanisms that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard online tracking system is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
