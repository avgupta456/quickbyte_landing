        These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and
        conditions of your use of the “QuickBites” mobile application (“Mobile
        Application” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services
        (collectively, “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between
        you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Mobile Application developer
        (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). By accessing and using the Mobile
        Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read,
        understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you
        are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal
        entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to
        this Agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall
        refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do
        not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not accept this
        Agreement and may not access and use the Mobile Application and
        Services. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you
        and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically
        signed by you, and it governs your use of the Mobile Application and
        Services.
